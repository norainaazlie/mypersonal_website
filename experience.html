  <h1 style="color: lightcoral; font-family: arial; line-height: 4.0em;">EXPERIENCE</h1>

  <p style="color: yellowgreen; font size: 30px; text-align: justify;">Assalamualaikum and Hi! Here, I want to share my experience when I first enter the university. From a young age I was exposed of the fun and myths of HAPPY as a university student. How wonderful to study at the university level. I am sure we have all been given the encouragement and enthusiasm to study up to the ivory tower level. The spirit of wanting to enter the university is exaggerated. So with that, I set the intention to continue my studies to university.

When I got a university offer, I was the happiest person, the most fun, to the point of tears. How fun it is to have the opportunity to continue studying at university. At the time, I was really looking forward to the check -in date. "I must have fun later ..." that's what I thought. However, the FACT is .....

The first week at university will be a week of introduction to a new world, a new world that I will explore as a university student. Where it initially steps in as an independent human being, living alone without the full help and attention of parents as I have always received. This first week, I will be involved with a university orientation. The busiest week I have to go through. A week full of various programs. Going out in the morning, the night is not necessarily over. There is not enough time to rest because time becomes short.

At university, I would be alone because I was still new, do not have friend yet. Everything moves on its own. No more people will help show the way. It’s a huge new world for me, it’s hard for me to start a move because I’m not an outwardly brave person. However, I have to fight it because life as a student is not easy. I have a lot to learn if I want to survive until I manage to grab a degree later.

After the introductory week, then officially began my journey at the university. My feelings are still mixed because I still haven’t gotten used to the new place, away from family. Previously, my learning could be said to be easy because school teachers were always there to educate attentively. However, not at the university. Here, the people in charge of imparting the knowledge are not the same as the school teachers who have educated me before. The person is not like the person I used to meet. Not a bunch of people, because the responsibility as a university lecturer is huge. The people are no longer called 'teachers', instead most of them are called <em>Dr., Prof.</em> and many more. This is a new thing I need to get used to. Before lecture, I had to always be prepared because no one would be waiting for me. The knowledge that I will learn in the lecture is not easy for me to accept even though it is about the knowledge that I have mastered before. The new environment and atmosphere made me sleepy and awkward in lectures. Task after task given makes me tired.

I not only have to prepare myself in faculty, but also in college I have to give my full commitment if I want to get a place next year. If I fail, then I need to be prepared to live in a rental house that is of course more expensive than college. Therefore, I need to get involved with the programs provided by the college as well as the university.

I became so busy that my eating and drinking were irregular, my sleep and rest were erratic. I became too tired and exhausted. Plus the feeling of longing for family that never stops. Day after day I survived, I counted the days waiting for leave to go home to meet my family. Sometimes I will question myself, is this my choice right? Is this really my way? Can I survive?

Yet, in retrospect, remembering my ordeal, my family, and others, I need to be grateful and strive to fight these feelings of mine. I cannot make all these sacrifices in vain. Yes, life at this university is difficult, but this path has been destined for me, I need to accept it fully, I need to carry it out well for my own good and fulfill the expectations of the family. Not everyone is given this opportunity as I received it. I need to be grateful and I need to be strong.

I believe many more are going through moments like this. The fact is that many are not able to survive to the end. Some stopped in the middle of the road because they were no longer able to survive. I always pray that my journey and that of my other friends will be successful to the end, successful in getting a degree.</p>
